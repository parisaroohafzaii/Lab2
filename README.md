Improvement: In lo_shu.py I changed the order of the output statements so that after a user inputs a set of 9 numbers, the result of      whether that set of numbers is a lo shu magic number is displayed first followed by the what failed specifically. I did this so you get your results immediately after the input rather than a few lines after. Therefore, the lines following that statement will go more into depth.
